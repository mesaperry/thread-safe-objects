# thread-safe-objects

This project aims to create a header-only, more RAII-like experience of C++ synchronization through Thread Safe Wrappers, which can encapsulate any object and forces accesses to be thread safe. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code typically associated with standard synchronous C++ code.
